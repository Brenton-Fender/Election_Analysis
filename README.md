# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is being completed for the Colorado Board of Elections regarding a recent congressional election. The tasks are as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.\

## Summary

This script has provided clear and concise data for the congressional election results. By using different input data in the form of a CSV file, the script can easily provide results to other similar elections including elections with completely different candidates, precincts, and counts of these variables.  This script could be quickly refactored to use in other elections. By changing small pieces of the code, the script could be used for state or local level elections as well. The script can handle any number of candidates and localities. I believe it would be in the best interest of the citizens of Colorado for the Colorado Board of Elections to continue to use this script to analyze elections.
